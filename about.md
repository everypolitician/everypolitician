We’re building a publicly available, open list of all the world’s politicians, in a standardised format. 

## Why? 

Because, if data is in a standard structured format, it can be reused by
developers everywhere. They don’t have waste time scraping data and
converting it into a format they can use; instead, they can simply
concentrate on making useful tools. 

And those tools can more easily be picked up, used and adapted to local
needs anywhere in the world, saving everyone time and effort.

That standardised format is [Popolo](http://www.popoloproject.com/), the
new data standard for politicians’ details.

## How do I get involved?

If you‘ve already published Popolo format data for your country’s
politicians (or know of such data for a country not on our map),
let us know, and we’ll add it to the growing list.

If you have the information in another format, and would like assistance
converting it to Popolo, talk to us, and we’ll see if we can help. We’re
building tools to make that process easier, and we’d love to test them
out on your data.

## Which politicians do you care about?

Initially we’re only collecting information about 
[country-level Parliaments and Congresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_country).
Eventually we hope that much more than this will be available, but we
think that getting every national legislature would be a great first
step.

## What information about them do you want?

Popolo lets you express lots of complex information about your
politicians and their history. If you have the time and skills to put
lots of that together, then great! The UK data, for example, lists 
[every Member of Parliament for the last 100 years](https://parliament.popit.mysociety.org/persons/). 

But for now we’re simply focussed on getting basic information about the
current legislators in every country. Even if you can only provide their
names, political parties, and areas they represent, that‘s plenty. Part
of the beauty of Popolo is that it’s easy to add more complex data at
any stage, and we’ll be encouraging people to do just that later.

## What next?

Each jurisdiction’s data can be used to populate a PopIt site, like
[this](https://sinar-malaysia.popit.mysociety.org/). 

PopIt sites are open to everyone, to use and also to edit. The data in
every PopIt site can be accessed via an API, so it can be used as the
foundation for any web tool.

PopIt sites can be used as standalone resources to publish politicians’
details, but they can also be used in bigger projects, such as making it
easy to [track what those politicians say](http://sayit.poplus.org/), or
for citizens to [send public messages to them](http://writeit.poplus.org/). 

As we collect more data from more countries, all in the same format,
more and more tools will become possible.
